# Required
# Our monitoring infrastructure requires environment names to be restricted. The names should be in
# the form `DEV-XX`, `STG-XX` or `PROD-XX`. For development environments, `DEV-01` through `DEV-08`
# are available. Most environments will be in the development category. Staging will be reserved for
# release candidates.
network-name: DEV-01
# The environment type determines the number and sizes of VMs for the environment.
# Possible values: development, staging, production.
environment-type: development

# Optional
# Remove any you don't want to use.

# A value between 2 and 255 should be supplied for the network ID.
# It is used to avoid cross-network interference.
# If you are testing against the production network, you don't need to supply this.

# The region to deploy to.
# For Digital Ocean, we currently support "lon1" and "ams3".

# EVM/funding configuration
