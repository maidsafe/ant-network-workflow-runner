# Required
# Our monitoring infrastructure requires environment names to be restricted. The names should be in
# the form `DEV-XX`, `STG-XX` or `PROD-XX`. For development environments, `DEV-01` through `DEV-08`
# are available. Most environments will be in the development category. Staging will be reserved for
# release candidates.
deployment-name: DEV-01
# The environment type determines the number and sizes of VMs for the environment.
# Possible values: development, staging, production.
environment-type: development

# For a client deployment, you must provide the ID of the network you want to connect to.
# 1 is for the production network and 2 is for the alpha network.
# Any other values between 3 and 255 are for ad-hoc testing networks.
network-id: 2

# Optional
# Remove any you don't want to use.

# The region to deploy to.
# For Digital Ocean, we currently support "lon1" and "ams3".
# It will default to "lon1".
