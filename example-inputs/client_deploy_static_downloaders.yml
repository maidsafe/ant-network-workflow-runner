# Required
# Our monitoring infrastructure requires environment names to be restricted. The names should be in
# the form `DEV-XX`, `STG-XX` or `PROD-XX`. For development environments, `DEV-01` through `DEV-08`
# are available. Most environments will be in the development category. Staging will be reserved for
# release candidates.
name: DEV-01
# The environment type determines the number and sizes of VMs for the environment.
# Possible values: development, staging, production.
environment-type: development

# For a static downloaders deployment, you must provide the ID of the network you want to connect to.
# 1 is for the production network and 2 is for the alpha network.
# Any other values between 3 and 255 are for ad-hoc testing networks.
network-id: 2

# Optional
# Remove any you don't want to use.

# The region to deploy to.
# For Digital Ocean, we currently support "lon1" and "ams3".
# It will default to "lon1".

# EVM/funding configuration

# Possible values for the EVM network type are, `anvil`, `custom`, `arbitrum-one` or `arbitrum-sepolia`.
# In the case of `custom`, you must specify the `evm-rpc-url`, the `evm-data-payments-address`,
# and `evm-payment-token-address`. The custom network is mainly useful for providing overrides for the
# token address.

# Use these inputs if you want some custom version of `testnet-deploy` to be
# used in the run. It can either be a branch on a fork, or a specific version.
# If you want to use a branch, both the `testnet-deploy-branch` and
# `testnet-deploy-repo-owner` inputs are required.  The vast majority of the
# time, you will just want to use the latest version of `testnet-deploy`, and so
# these inputs can be removed.
